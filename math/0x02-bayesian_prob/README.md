### [0. Likelihood](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/math/0x02-bayesian_prob/0-likelihood.py "0. Likelihood")

You are conducting a study on a revolutionary cancer drug and are looking to find the probability that a patient who takes this drug will develop severe side effects. During your trials, `n` patients take the drug and `x` patients develop severe side effects. You can assume that `x` follows a binomial distribution.

The function `likelihood(x, n, P)` calculates the likelihood of obtaining this data given various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects.
