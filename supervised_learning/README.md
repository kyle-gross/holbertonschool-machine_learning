# Supervised Learning

## [Classification](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning/0x01-classification "Classification")

A classic introduction project for machine learning, classification of the MNIST handwritten digit dataset. These neural nets were created using only `numpy`.

---

## [Tensorflow](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning/0x00-tensorflow "Tensorflow")

Introduction to Tensorflow, another classification project for the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.

---

## [Optimization](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning/0x01-optimization "Optimization")

Introduction to machine learning optimization. In this project I learned techniques such as regularization, normalization, batch normalization, learning rate decay, and gradient descent optimizers.

---

## [Regularization](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning/0x01-regularization "Regularization")

A project covering a few regularization techniques such as L1 & L2 regularization, dropout, and early stopping.

---

## [Error Analysis](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning/0x00-error_analysis "Error Analysis")

Covers several analysis methods:

* Confusion matrix
* Precision/recall
* F1 score

---

## [Keras](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning/0x02-keras "Keras")

In this project I used Keras to once again classify the MNIST handwritten digit dataset, but also incorporated many optimization and regularization techniques that we learned in previous projects.

---

## [CNN](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning/0x00-cnn "CNN")

Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks. I created forward and backward propagation for convolutions and pooling using numpy. And then created 2 a Lenet5 using Keras.

---

## [Deep CNNs](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning/0x01-deep_cnns "Deep CNNs")

A variety of CNN models are explored in this project. These include:

* Inception network
* Resnet500
* Densenet121

---

## [Transfer Learning](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning/0x02-transfer_learning "Transfer Learning")

In this project I took a pre-trained model and trained it to classify the cifar10 image dataset.

---

## [Face Verification](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning/0x01-face_verification "Face Verification")

This project uses a CNN to verify faces.

---

## [RNNs](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning/0x00-RNNs "RNNs")

In this project I created several types of RNN cells (GRU & LSTM) and a bidirectional RNN using `numpy`.

---

## [Word Embeddings](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning/0x00-word_embeddings "Word Embeddings")

An introduction to NLP techniques:

* Bag of words
* tf idf
* word2vec
* fasttext

---

## [NLP Metrics](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning/0x01-nlp_metrics "NLP Metrics")

Introduction to some NLP evaluation metrics.

---

## [Transformer Apps](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/supervised_learning/0x02-transformer_apps/0-dataset.py "Transformer Apps")

Uses `Tensorflow` to create a machine translation transformer.

---

## [QA Bot](https://github.com/kyle-gross/holbertonschool-machine_learning/tree/main/supervised_learning/0x03-qa_bot "QA Bot")

A simple question answer bot. Answers questions based on reference texts.
